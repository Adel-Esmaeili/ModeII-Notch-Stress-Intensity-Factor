by fitting equation 8 to shear stress data (file name = Shear_Stress_along_BIsector_Omega_NotchDepth), file C_data file can be determined.
then by fitting equation 12 to the C_Data, ABCD_Coefficients file Can be extracted.
And by fitting equation 13 to ABCD_Coefficients data, EFGH_Coefficient file can be obtained.

And finally, by sorting EFGH_Coefficient after each other, File AbcD can be created, then by fitting equations 14 to these data, the coefficient of the equation 14 can be determined.
